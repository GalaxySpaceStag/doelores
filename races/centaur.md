## Centaur

Centaurs generally lived in tribal hunter-gatherer societies. They had good relations with elves, being as they were both creatures of the forest. Reclusive wanderers and omen-readers of the wild, Centaurs avoid conflict but fight fiercely when pressed. They roam the vast wilderness, keeping far from borders, laws, and the company of other creatures.
