## Aranea

Araneas are intelligent shapechanging spiderfolk, less exploitative than doppelgangers and usually not evil despite most preconceptions about spiders. They have many skills, can assume the form of a humanoid, cast webs and spells, and even have a poisonous bite. Araneas make moderate melee combatants or rogues, but their natural shapechanging and spellcasting ability make them excellent spies and sorcerers, and they are reasonably good divine spellcasters.
