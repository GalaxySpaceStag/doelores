# Way of the Wire

### Monofilament Wires

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can form strong razor sharp wire threads with your ki that you control with your fingers. These wires allow you your unarmed strikes gain a tocounts as a monk weapon and have a reach of 30 feet and deal 1d4 slashing damage. When you attack with these wires and hit the target, you can spend 1 ki point to restrain your target as a bonus action. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or it becomes restrained until the end of your next turn. In addition, as a reaction you can pull an object within reach to your hand by using your wires.

### Death by a Thousand Cuts

At 6th level, you gain more precise control of the wires formed by your ki. As an action, you make a ranged attack with your wires against a creature within 30 feet. On a hit, the target becomes connected to you. This effect ends if you break the connection as an action or if the target is more than 30 feet away from you. As an bonus action, you can deal 1d10 slashing damage automatically to multiple targets connected by your wires. You can increase the damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 1d10. Additionally, damage inflicted by these wires count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Puppet Performance

At 11th level, your training gives you complete control of your wires. As an reaction, when enemies or objects are connected by your wires you can spend 3 ki points to cast dominate person or animate objects, as appropriate. In addition, you know the exact location of those connected and you can whisper messages only the target can hear through the wires.

### Arachnids Web

At 17th level, your training lets you create the most sharp wires in existence. As an action, you rapidly spin a mass of thin, sharp wires at your location to form a web. The web fills a 60-foot cube from your location for an hour and requires concentration. You must then finish a short or long rest to use this feature again. The web has the following effects:

* If the wires aren't anchored between two solid masses \(such as walls or trees\) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the wires collapses on itself, and the web ends at the start of your next turn. Wires layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
* The area becomes difficult terrain for hostile creatures and the wires can't be spotted unless a creature uses his action to inspect the area and must succeed on an Intelligence \(Investigation\) check against your  
  spell save DC.
* A hostile creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or the wires will cut off one of their limbs. If such a loss is indicated, you should roll 1d10 to determine the exact nature of the injury. On a roll of 1-9, the target has lost an arm or leg \(determined by the DM\). Such a loss also inflict damages equal to one-quarter the targets base hit points. If the roll was a 10, the target has been beheaded and is  
  instantly killed.
