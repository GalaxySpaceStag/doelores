# Berserker Armor
A forlorn black swordsman who vanished into myths and legends standing on a bloodstained battlefield against hordes of demons wearing a dark armor with a visored helm shaped like a wolfâ€™s head. He who dons that armor and aligns with the ominous flow of Od dwelling therein truly becomes a savage. He is driven by such violent emotions he forgets about things like pain and fear. Humans have unconsciously established bounds to their strength so that they do not harm their own bodies. Pain is a warning to keep us from destroying ourselves. A human without pain realizes unbelievable strength, reflexes, and perception. He surpasses the limits of the human body at the risk of his own life.

This dark armor was forged a long time ago by dwarves. The armor completely numbs the wearers senses to pain, and enhances his every movement. It unlocks the wearers muscles, allowing them to use their full strength, at the risk of permanent damage to both their body and mind. With a chance to turn its wearer into a mindless beast unable to determine friend from foe.

The armor can even reinforce broken limbs by piercing through the wearers flesh and biting into his bones. It is even said that the previous owners of this armor were similarly devoured by its steel teeth as they continued fighting on the battlefield, until the last of there blood gushed from where there bones were broken.

### Berserker Armor
*Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement by a barbarian)*<br/>
You are proficient in this armor while attunned with it, and you can use all your barbarian class abilities while wearing this armor.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you are wearing this armor:
- You gain a +2 bonus to AC.
- Your rage damage is doubled.
- Your levels of exhaustion are surpressed.
- You can take a Dash action as a bonus action.
- You do not know how much damage is dealt to you when you are damaged. However you can continue to fight even when at or below 0 hitpoints until your rage ends. But when your rage is over you apply all the damage you have suffered immediately. This damage to you can't be reduced or prevented in any way. This ability does not prevent death from massive damage that would instantly kill you or from spell effects such as disintegrate.

**Curse.** Your rage now only ends when there are no hostile creatures present within 60 feet. After that you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk and continue to rage till your berserk is over. A full spellcaster within 60 feet of you can use her reaction to help you by suppressing the curse and give you advantage on the saving throw. 

While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. 

When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion and if you went beserk you're also afflicted with one level of long-term madness.
